1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

it helps to focus on what is changed only

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

if you make mistakes in the new version, you can easily switch it back.

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

it would be too small for a version if you automatically saved? when you decide by yourself, it will be more logically and easier to compare later with the versions

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log will show all the commits, with time, commit id etc. git diff will compare two versions and find the differences.
